Abstract
With the advancement of Wi-Fi sensing technology, its significant benefits in
convenient operation and privacy protection have become apparent, particularly
in fields like smart homes, medical monitoring, and security surveillance, where
the application prospects of Human Activity Recognition (HAR) technology are
increasingly broad. This study focuses on a novel approach to HAR using Wi-Fi
Channel State Information (CSI), especially under complex conditions such as
Non-Line of Sight (NLoS) paths and through-wall transmissions. Traditionally,
most research has concentrated on Line of Sight (LoS) path HAR, sensitive to
environmental changes, while the NLoS path signals, especially through-wall signals, present unpredictability due to weak reflections caused by walls. Addressing
this issue, we propose Wi-SensiNet, an innovative deep learning-based method
that combines the spatial feature extraction capabilities of Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNN) with the temporal sequence processing power of Bidirectional
Long Short-Term Memory networks (BiLSTM). This method also incorporates
an attention mechanism to enhance the accuracy of human activity recognition in complex environments. Wi-SensiNet is specially designed for through-wall
settings, effectively handling the complexity of CSI data, and achieving accurate through-wall human activity detection. In our experiments, we collected
a through-wall CSI dataset comprising seven common activities, including running, sitting, standing, squatting, falling, punching, and walking, and verified
Wi-SensiNet’s average accuracy exceeded 99% on the original test set. These
results not only demonstrate the model’s robustness and high accuracy in handling HAR tasks in complex environments but also highlight the potential of
CNN and BiLSTM working in tandem to enhance performance.

Introduction
In recent years, Human Activity Recognition (HAR) has increasingly found applications in fields such as smart homes, medical monitoring, and security surveillance.Particularly with the proliferation of smart devices and the advancement of
Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, Wi-Fi sensing technology has been increasingly
applied, harnessing a detectable feature within Wi-Fi signals known as Channel State
Information (CSI).This type of data can intricately illustrate how wireless signals
are transmitted between sending and receiving devices, where movement of a person
within the Wi-Fi signal propagation path induces changes in the signal’s phase and
amplitude.These alterations are reflected in the CSI, a characteristic of Wi-Fi signals, offering detailed insights into the signal propagation path, transmission time,
and attenuation.Consequently, by analyzing the variations in CSI data, one can infer
changes in human movement and positioning.Compared to traditional methods reliant
on visual or wearable sensors, this approach offers a more covert and non-line-ofsight dependent solution.Wi-Fi-based Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is achieved
through the reception of both Signal Strength Information (RSSI) and Channel State
Information (CSI).In comparison to RSS, CSI can provide detailed channel frequency
response information[1] on multiple channels at the physical layer, offering finer granularity than RSSI and the ability to distinguish multipath components, rendering it
more effective in recognizing complex human movements.Owing to its high-resolution
characteristics, CSI has emerged as a pivotal technology in the HAR domain, particularly excelling in applications requiring precise capture and analysis of human
dynamics.
The majority of solutions for Human Activity Recognition (HAR) based on
Channel State Information (CSI) in specific environments employ deep learning techniques, including gesture recognition[2][3], motion detection[4][5], and fall
detection[6][7].However, researchers often conduct their studies in ideal environments
with relatively simple Wi-Fi signal propagation. Due to the poor interference resistance of Wi-Fi signals, the accuracy of these solutions may significantly diminish
in more complex scenarios such as through-wall or Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) conditions.However, these complex scenarios often represent the primary application
contexts for human activity recognition.The challenges encountered in human perception through walls using Wi-Fi include technical limitations such as signal attenuation,
multipath interference, signal noise, environmental factors like wall composition,
dynamic environments, as well as privacy and ethical considerations.Consequently,
achieving high-accuracy human activity recognition in complex environments has
become a critical issue.Human Activity Recognition based on CSI fundamentally
involves analyzing the impact of human activity on wireless signals, suggesting that
a potential solution to the aforementioned issues is to extract and utilize the most
representative features within the wireless signals.Addressing these challenges is crucial for the advancement of this field.Robust algorithms, models, and frameworks
are required to mitigate the effects of signal issues and adapt to dynamic environments.Furthermore, the latest advancements in Multiple-Input Multiple-Output
(MIMO) communications and the utilization of Wi-Fi signals offer a promising avenue
to realize this goal.

In this study, we conducted an in-depth analysis of the original Channel State Information (CSI), with a particular focus on the impact of signal attenuation and minor
movements on CSI in through-wall scenarios.To fully extract features, we treated the
data from each antenna as an independent input channel, incorporating both timedomain and frequency-domain information.Additionally, we employed median filtering
to optimize data quality and reduce noise, coupled with the introduction of Gaussian
noise enhancement to simulate uncertainties in real-world environments, effectively
mitigating noise interference caused by minor and inadvertent movements.These
strategies collectively enhanced the reliability of the data, improving the model’s
performance and adaptability in complex environments.
In summary, this research makes the following key contributions:
• In addressing the challenges of datasets in through-wall scenarios, we devised and
applied a data processing strategy combining median filtering with Gaussian noise,
which not only effectively reduced data noise but also significantly enhanced the
quality and generalizability of the data.Training with pre-processed data led to a
substantial increase in accuracy on the original dataset.
• We introduced the Wi-SensiNet approach, which integrates Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNN) with Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) networks,
incorporating an attention mechanism to establish an advanced framework for
time-series analysis. The specially tailored BiLSTM modules process deep features
extracted by the CNN layers, and the incorporated attention layer further optimizes
the model’s recognition of critical temporal steps, enhancing the overall accuracy
and robustness of the model in understanding and predicting complex time-series
data.
• We collected and constructed a through-wall dataset encompassing nine common
human activities, including running, sitting, standing, squatting, falling, punching,
and standing.By applying the Wi-SensiNet method, we achieved an average accuracy
of 99% on the original dataset, validating the efficacy and precision of our approach
in practical applications. application.
